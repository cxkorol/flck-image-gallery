## What can be improved in my opinion if I'll spend more time and some comments

- I prefer to write descriptive and readable Git commit messages, considering opening one PR per feature.
- Enhance error handling to provide better user experience.
- Implement code coverage with tests.
- Optimize the mobile flow, considering the primary target browser was Chrome desktop.
- Implement a header and footer for better SEO.
- Consider deploying the GUI on a server.
